# An isometric tile based renderer for react(no Canvas) 
[DEMO](http://sajit.me/react-isometric-render/)

A fun project where I wanted to learn how isometric tile system works and also wanted to see how React's virtual dom would react to rendering multiple components at a time. And I am amazed to see the result.

![Sample](https://github.com/sajitkhadka/react-tile-render/blob/master/src/assets/img/output.PNG)

## WARNING!

This is completely based on browser dom with react(nothing related to CANVAS). Hence, if it is requires multiple re-rendering it will be slow.

## Steps

`npm install`
`npm start`
and see the results.

> Feel free to tweak and change the way you like. I don't exactly know how much we can work on this without breaking the DOM, but it is fun.
> For the tilemap I used tiled map editor(https://www.mapeditor.org/) to generate array of sprite objects.

I don't own any of the assets used. I found these online.

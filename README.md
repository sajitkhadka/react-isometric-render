# An isometric tile based renderer for react

![Sample](https://github.com/sajitkhadka/react-tile-render/blob/master/src/assets/img/output.png?raw=true)

## WARNING!

This is completely based on browser dom(nothing related to CANVAS). Hence, if it is requires multiple re-rendering then it is highly recommended to use html Canvas as this will be painfully slow.

## Steps

`npm install npm start`

The isometric tile renderer supports tiled map editor (https://www.mapeditor.org/). However, you must pass the sprite-sheet as separate image.
